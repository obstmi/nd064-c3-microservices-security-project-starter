Kubernetes Cluster Hardening â€“ System Stability Test Plan

The primary objective of this test plan is to ensure that security hardening measures applied to a Kubernetes cluster do not compromise system stability, availability, or functionality. 
All hardening configurations will first be implemented in a non-production, staging environment that mirrors the production cluster as closely as possible, including similar workloads, node types, network policies, and access controls.

How will we test the changes?
We will use a multi-phase approach to validate the changes. 
Initially, automated conformance tests will be run to verify that the cluster remains compliant with Kubernetes specifications. 
Next, we will deploy representative workloads and perform functional tests on core services, including ingress controllers, DNS resolution, logging, and monitoring. 
Load testing tools will simulate realistic traffic to evaluate performance under load.

How will we ensure the changes don't negatively affect the cluster?
We will closely monitor key health indicators including pod restarts, node resource usage, network latency, and application error rates. 
Alerts will be configured via Prometheus and Grafana to detect anomalies. 
A rollback plan will be in place for each hardening step to ensure fast recovery in case of degradation. 
Only after passing all tests without regressions will changes be considered for production. 
Finally, a canary deployment strategy will be used to gradually apply hardening in production, ensuring real-world stability before full rollout.
