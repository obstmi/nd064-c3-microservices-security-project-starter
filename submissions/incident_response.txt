1. Incident commander name:
Michael Obst

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
Three pods in the default namespace of our Kubernetes cluster were started without permission. 
These pods run cryptomining software.

3. Summary of what was affected:
The Kubernetes cluster was directly affected by the deployment of the cryptomining pods.

4. Summary of the impact:
The cryptomining pods consumed a significant amount of computing resources.
This can affect the performance of the regular software and even block or crash the Kuberntes cluster. 
Due to the early detection, however, an external impact could be avoided.

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
The corresponding pods were promptly identified and terminated in order to mitigate resource consumption and security risks. 
The Kubernetes cluster configuration and security policies has been checked carefully. If necessary, all software versions have been updated.
Passwords were exchanged and the kubeconfig file was regenerated.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
Regular and ideally automated analysis and hardening of the attack surface of the system is a basic requirement.
This includes the regular installation of software patches and updates as well as compliance with access guidelines.
Runtime monitoring is also essential in order to detect and rectify security incidents at an early stage.
